**Joke:**
**Q:** Why did the AI break up with its computer?
**A:** Because it couldn't handle the constant **CTRL + ALT + DELETE!**

ðŸ§  **Explanation:**
"Ctrl + Alt + Delete" is a key combination often used to:

* Restart a computer
* Open Task Manager (on Windows)
* Force quit processes

So the joke is that the AI found the constant interruptions or restarts too stressfulâ€”just like relationship drama. ðŸ’”ðŸ’»

Want me to generate more AI or programming jokes like this?
